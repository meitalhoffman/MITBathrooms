# MIT Bathrooms
## Final project for 11.S905 Computational Urban Science Workshop
### Meital Hoffman
### Spring 2019

My final project centered around the location of different gendered and non-gendered bathrooms on MIT's campus. I created a tool where you could place an avatar on a map of MIT's campus and the tool would route your avatar to the nearest men's, women's, and gender neutral bathroom. The project was meant to highlight the continued unequal access to bathroom facilities based on gender identity. Part of this problem is inherent in the building of MIT, which was first deisgned only to serve male students. The data were provided by MIT Facilities.
